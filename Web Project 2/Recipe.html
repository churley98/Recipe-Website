			<h2>Classic Hamburger</h2>	
				
			<p id="description">The Hamburger. A Classic in it's own right was said to have been created as early as 1884 with references in the Boston journal made to "Hamburger Steaks".</p><br>
			<p> Regardless of where it was originally created though, it has become a staple of the outdoor barbeque. There are many creative and unique ways to make this classic, but today we are going to go with the tried and true method of preparation. So fire up your grill and let's get started. </p>

			<h3>STEPS</h3>
			<h5><span class="textColor">HAMBURGER PREPERATION</span></h5>
			<p>The first thing you want to do is, in a large mixing bowl combine the hamburger, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Mix with your hands for about 2 minutes.
			Remove hamburger patty mix and place on clean surface. After this you want to take a small chunk (about 1/4 the mix or however big you want your burgers to be.</p><br>
			
			<p> In your hands roll each chunk into a spherical ball and place on surface. With your palm apply pressure to the middle and make a hamburger patty.
			 Repeat this for the rest of the mix. After set each patty on a plate and move to the grill.</p>
			
			<h5><span class="textColor">ON THE GRILL</span></h5>	
			<p>Heat up a Gas or Charcoal grill and season with Oil as needed.</p><br>
			<p> Before placing patty, brush both side with Cooking Oil.</p><br>
			<p> Grill the burgers until Golden Brown and a little charred on one side, then flip do the same for the other side. This is also the time you want to add Buns to the grill if you want some nice hot Hamburger buns. Depending on how rare you want your burgers to be you will want to cook each side for at least 4 minutes each side for medium rare and up to 7 minutes if you want them well done.</p> 
			
			
			
			<h5>WHILE GRILLING</h5>
			<p>While the burgers are cooking, gather all your toppings and start putting together your burgers.</p>
			<p> if you added the buns to the grill wait till the burgers are almost done and remove them and make your burger toppings</p>
			
			<h5><span class="textColor">AFTER HAMBURGERS ARE DONE</span></h5>
			<p>After you are happy with the level of doneness, remove the patties and place them on an empty bun and let cool for a minute or two.</p><br>
			<p> Finally grab your favorite beverage and. . .</p><br>
